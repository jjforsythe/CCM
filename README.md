# Convex Constrained Meshes

This is the source code which implements the algorithm described in the article entitled "Convex Constrained Meshes for superpixel segmentations of images".
This is to be published in the SPIE Journal of Electronic Imaging -- Special Issue on Superpixels for Image Processing and Computer Vision.

## Compiling

In order to compile the program you will need to install the following libraries: 

OpenCV http://opencv.org/

CGAL https://www.cgal.org/

OpenMesh https://www.openmesh.org/


We also make use of 

Triangle https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html

Line Segment Detector (LSD) http://www.ipol.im/pub/art/2012/gjmr-lsd/

and the source code for these are included in this repository.
